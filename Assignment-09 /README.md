The Element is for the style of the individual parts of the page but not necessarily attributed to the entire page just small pieces of it.  The Id is just an identification that does not show up on the page unless hovered over to discover what is something for an example a photography might have an Id to describe what it is.  Class is for an entire group of elements.
