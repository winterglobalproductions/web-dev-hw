I Decided to take this class because I am a masochist who enjoys suffering and pain. I also only speak English and Spanish it would be good to speak a third language.  I actually did not want to take this class, I wanted to take a class in the classroom and not online. But it was not offered at the right times for me. And learning online I can do anytime I am free.  

Three Things I learned include:

1. Web Programming is Incredibly Difficult.

2.  I don't know anything.

3.  I hope to learn how to make my own boring weebly webpage much more exciting.
