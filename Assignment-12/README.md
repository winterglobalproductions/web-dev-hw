13.  I am my own imaginary client.  But me being quite real I found myself hard to deal with.  

14.  The differences are apparent between display in-line and display in-line block in how CSS Separates the boxes and puts them in line instead of over each other so that the display is much easier to read.  

15.  I duplicated the HTML on all for pages in on Atom so that they all had the same display and style that I wrote on the original index page.  Then I went into each individual page and changed the content and the style to the design I wanted for the pages.  I wrote divs and li for the list at the top of the page.
