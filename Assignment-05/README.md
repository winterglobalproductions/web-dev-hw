13.  Standard HTML Structure is just one Head element and one Body.
14.  Structural are the actual structure of paragraphs and text.  Semantics are the more fluffy stuff like bold and italics that make the actual structural text more interesting.  
15.  For question 15 refer to image... ![Image of Delicious Dish](Images/bacon.jpg) I read from the webpage, typed in the readme file when I could find an answer.  Then took a break to sample from my recipe book.  Then I went back to reading the Jon Duckett book to try to find out more about The Semantics of HTML.  But first before anything I created an Assignment-05 folder to put images and and index in.  I created an index with a heading body and text.  When I was done I tried to upload the HTML Document through GitHub Desktop and pushing it to the WebDev Site.
