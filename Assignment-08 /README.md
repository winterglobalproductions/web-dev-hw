13.  I took HTML 18 years ago and not really much has changed with the original HTML but now there are other forms of HTML such as HTML5 and things can be enhanced with CSS.  The general form of the pages where much simpler.  Everything moves towards more complexity.  

14.  I'm not at all familiar with CSS so I don't know what to expect or what I will learn.  

15.  I used a preexisting assignment directory so that I didn't have to retype all the HTML code for three different pages.  I made three separate pages and linked them together with an href to be able to go to each page.  I saved the assignment and pushed it to the web-dev.
