<h1>Ephemeral</h1>
<h2>by: <b>Winter Ramos</b></h2>
<hr />
<p> Ephemeral like drops of dew on a peddle of an untouched flower
Ephemeral like the brush of skin from a touch of a woman's hand
(As the sun hits the liquid rolls down the pedal and drops to the dirt below)
(And the simple touch stops breath and with a wink is gone)
Ephemeral like a laugh in a nighttime bar as it closes
To tears in the empty street of dawn and fog
<br />
<br />
Ephemeral like a woman's lips on your spine for the last time
