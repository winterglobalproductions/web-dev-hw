<p>I actually have books in my collection that I got in my last year in high school that are still there.  I visited a couple places as a young person I was always a reader and I visited some members of the family that had collections of books and I thought wouldn’t it be wonderful if someone in my family collected books and I would stand in line to inherit them.  I was thinking selfishly of course. But that wasn’t the case, no chance anywhere in my immediate family so I just consciously in my senior year in high school that I would begin a collection that someday I would have a collection that somebody else could inherit.
</p>
The first year in college I lived in a dorm I had a shelf about so long above a desk and I put half a dozen or eight books up there and I said, that’s the beginning.

I’ve been gathering books ever since.  At a certain point and it happened sort of serendipitously because I went to a lot of garage sales in order to acquire books because I wasn’t rich so I couldn’t afford to buy new books so I was always on the look out for used books and at one point I went to a garage sale and I discovered a small collection of pop bottles with no interest or intension of collecting pop bottle until I saw them and I realized that it was an instant collection so I started looking for pop bottles and that blossomed into a rather large collection of pop bottles and ultimately a whole variety of collections all as I see it semi related to my book collection.

I like dressing out a particular selection of books, a subsection if you will with some tchotchkes some little items that are cool and somehow connect to the subject matter that the books are covering.  And that has allowed me to have quite a variety of other little tangential collections.

Books are my mane force, I’ve been doing for, I’m 73 now I acquired my first books when I was 18 so what that 55? 55 years.  If you add a slow and stead way of doing something after awhile you’ve really done something.   I have now almost just within a few books 24,000 obtained over a 55 year period.  The vast majority obtained used or as remainders which is another way to get books cheap.  There are companies a couple in particular that buy the remaining stock from a publisher from a book that is no longer selling well that it costs.  They just unload them to these companies and then the companies sell them for 10 cents on the dollar.  You can buy, that paperback that I’m reading right now I’m bought for 4.95 brand new.
<p>
James Joyce has always been a particular hero of mine and I really find Ulysses fascinating.  The book that I have that is of special interest to me is a copy of Ulysses, it’s just the random house addition so it would be nothing special except that three scholars put out a book in which they took all three of the major additions the major British the major American and I don’t remember the other but all three have variations and are not all exactly the same.  That’s not surprising because Joyce’s original writing of Ulysses was added to and added to and changed, he would get a set of proofs and make a bunch of changes on it and give it back to the printer.  Then he would get it back and then make a bunch more changes and that his style, his word order and his punctuation where very idiosyncratic that in the end it was hard to say what the real final copy was.   So these three scholars took the three major additions, read through each of them, compared them and made a somewhat arbitrary decision to what the best reading should be.   I took my copy of Ulysses and read it page by page and there is a change on almost every page.

I was fortunate enough to raid the library of an older man if you will, he allowed me to buy a bunch of his books at very reasonable prices but they where primarily anthropology books or early literary travel books addressing indigenous peoples that where 125 years old.  In other words these where people that encountered indigenous peoples when they where completely unaffected or only slightly effected by the modern world.  They recorded this stuff and they are really really interesting and quite valuable.  I have about 150 that fall into that category and they are very special.  But I have never been collecting books on purpose because they where valuable, I’m collecting them because they are interesting.
</p>
My very in-depth collection of American literature and of British literature are really special to m a-mass, as a whole because they are so complete.  They have a great deal of depth.  Not just the novels themselves but the indented material, critical studies, memoirs of the authors, collections of letter, of diaries, and journals.  My best example is my Earnest Hemingway collection, by the way I have an Earnest Hemingway signature which is pretty cool.  I have about 150 books in that collection by or about Hemingway.  Also memoirs of a whole bunch of people that new Hemingway and that’s a pretty cool collection because it’s so full bodied.

 I’ve always had a nice book collection on alternate consciousness and psychedelics so I went in my library and found this book.  When the Impossible happens. Stanislav Grof is a long time experimenter with psychedelic drugs.  Particularly interested in studying the neurochemical changes in the brain and from a psychiatrist point of view he’s an MD psychiatrist and has a PhD and has written extensively on the use of psychedelics in psychiatric work.  I find that really interesting, this is a summary of encounters of individuals that he has worked with many of them using a part of there therapy some psychedelic usually LSD.
<p>
My largest other collection is Western Americana, I love reading the journals ext. of explorers and early pioneers in Western America.
