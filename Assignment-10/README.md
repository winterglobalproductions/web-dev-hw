13.  I used a Montserrat font that I found on Google Fonts because Montserrat is a mountain outside of Barcelona in Catalonia that I have been to and my Spanish girlfriend's name was Montserrat.  I also used a font called Karla because I like the name Karla.

14.   The difference between a system font and a web-font is one is downloaded to my computer and the other is web-based but the problem with both they can sometimes not be read correctly and it is important to have a backup font that is universally understandable on all platforms.  System fonts have problems with licensing. Web-fonts do not.   

15.  I read through the web-page material several times but am completely lost when it comes to CSS.  I tried to link several different fonts that I found on Google Fonts but they didn't work.  I re-read the instructions several more times and tried to figure out the differences between the different font systems and got more confused.
