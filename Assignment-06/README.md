questions

14.    Text input example could be Your Name in a box, A button input is for more visual appearance such as the little button with a magnifying glass for searching.  A selection box is for predetermined choices such as a form with several questions or an online test with multiple choice questions.   
15.  I opened Atom and created a new assignment page.  I read the work instructions and then opened the web-page to tread the PDF of our text book and answer the questions for this README file.  I worked on the index html to create a form and I pushed the page through GitHub to view my website periodically as I worked.
